Team Vanir's repo
===========

This branch is for Vanir's android-4.2.2_r1 based ROM with Snuzzo/Funky-Kernel baked in


Getting Started
---------------

Please see the [Android source page](http://source.android.com/source/index.html) for building instructions.

To initialize your local repository using my trees, use the following command:

    repo init -u git://github.com/Snuzzo/platform_manifest.git -b jb42
    
To add a kernel (i.e TF700T)
	Sync, open the manifest folder and look for your kernel.
	Run the kernel script from the root directory.  For example"
	. ./manifest/700-kernel/kernel.sh

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -j8
